# SCISSOR
Welcome to scissor. A simple, seamless url-shortener and qr-code generator. 

## FUNCTIONALITIES 
- URL Shortening
Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scissor platform and a shorter URL gets generated when the 'Get Link' button. 
- Custom URLs
Scissor also allows users to customize their shortened URLs. Users can choose their own custom domain name and customize the URL to reflect their brand or content.
- QR Code Generation:
Scissor allows users to also generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. 
- Link History
Scissor allows users to see the history of links theyâ€™ve created so they can easily find and reuse links they have previously created
- Analytics
Scissor provides basic analytics that allow users to track their shortened URL's performance. Users can see how many clicks their shortened URL has received and the IP addresses from where the clicks are coming from. This is available in the 'History' tab.
